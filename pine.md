      Device Changelogs:
       - made sure tree is stable (fixed sepolicy issues, fixed some reported issue, etc)
       - the 200mb increase in size is face unlock and system optimizations
      
      Notes:
       - if stock camera hangs when zooming, dont slide/swipe the zoom slider instead just tap it
       - if stock camera force closes when switching to front cam on video mode just change the quality to 720p on settings 
       - face unlock is partially working, just find a spot where sunlight/lighting is good and finish the circle/face scan, it will say failed but just close the settings app or press canceled, the face model is added (will be fixed upon further release or on mi439 tree)
